# Project: Microservices-led E-commerce website
Designing APIs for an E-commerce Website.
(Step-by-Step Guide: [Project Step-by-Step Guide](src/main/java/README.md))

Integrated the following services based on the microservice based architecture for this project:

1.  Product Service    :    (  Current repository  )
2.  User Service       :    https://github.com/dipanshu18881/UserService
3.  Email Service      :    https://github.com/dipanshu18881/EmailService
4.  Payment Service    :    https://github.com/dipanshu18881/PaymentService

### High-Level Design (HLD) for E-commerce Website

### Architecture Components

1. Load Balancers (LB)

> Function: Distribute incoming user requests across multiple server instances to balance load and ensure high availability. 
> Tool: Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB).

2. API Gateway

> Function: Entry point for clients. Routes requests to the right microservices, handles rate limiting, and manages authentication. 
> Tool: Kong.

3. Microservices

> **3.1 User Management Service**
> _-> Handles user registration, login, profile management, and password reset. 
> -> Uses MySQL as the primary database for structured user data. 
> -> Uses Kafka to communicate relevant user activities to other services (e.g., a new user registration event can trigger welcome emails or offers)._

> **3.2 Product Catalog Service**
> _-> Manages product listings, details, categorization. 
> -> Uses MySQL. 
> -> Incorporates Elasticsearch for fast product searches, providing features like full-text search and typo correction._

> **3.3 Cart Service**
> _-> Manages user's shopping cart. 
> -> Uses MongoDB for flexibility in cart structures. 
> -> Uses Redis for fast, in-memory data access (e.g., to quickly retrieve a userâ€™s cart)._

> **3.4 Order Management Service**
> _-> Handles order processing, history, and tracking. 
> -> Uses MySQL. 
> -> Communicates with Payment Service and User Management Service through Kafka for order status updates, payment verifications, etc._

> **3.5 Payment Service**
> _-> Manages payment gateways and transaction logs. 
> -> Uses MySQL. 
> -> Once the payment is confirmed, it produces a message on Kafka to notify the Order Management Service._

> **3.6 Notification Service:**
> _-> Manages email and potentially other notifications (e.g., SMS). 
> -> Consumes Kafka messages for events that require user notifications (like registration confirmations, order updates). 
> -> Integrates with third-party platforms like Amazon SES for actual email delivery._

4. Databases (Relational and NoSQL)

> MySQL: For structured data. 
> MongoDB: For flexible, unstructured data.

5. Message Broker (Kafka)

> Central message broker allowing asynchronous communication between microservices, ensuring data consistency, and acting as an event store for critical actions.

6. Caching (Redis)

> Primarily by Cart Service for faster response times.

7. Search and Analytics (Elasticsearch)

> Used by Product Catalog for fast and relevant product searches.


### Typical Flow with Kafka & Elasticsearch Integration

Part 1

> -> User logs in and searches for a product.
> -> Request reaches LB, then passed to API Gateway. 
> -> API Gateway routes the search request to Product Catalog Service. 
> -> Product Catalog Service queries Elasticsearch for a fast product search.

Part 2

> -> User adds a product to the cart. 
> -> Cart Service produces a message to Kafka about this action.

Part 3

> -> User checks out, triggering the Order Management Service. 
> -> After placing the order, a message is sent to Kafka. 
> -> Payment Service consumes the Kafka message to process payment.
